# pyviso2: SWIG python bindings for libviso2
Fork of https://github.com/jlowenz/pyviso2, with additional wrappers for exposing the matching API (the original only contained wrappers for Visual Odometry).

## Installation instructions
Make sure you have SWIG installed (on Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install swig`), and then you can use pip to install pyviso2.

`` cd src/ ``

`` pip install -e . ``
